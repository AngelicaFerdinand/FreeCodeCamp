        <p>Every once in a great while, an artist or entertainer comes along and captivates the world. I grew up mesmerized by one such performer, and his name was Prince. Prince Rogers Nelson was born in 1958, and by the age of 17 he was already doing demo
          recordings.</p>
        <p>Prince really began to be a household name around the release of the film and album, Purple Rain. </p>
        <p>Prince could write music & lyrics, sang, and was credited with playing 27 different instruments! He was an incredibly prolific artist in the studio and there are many, many unreleased songs in his catalog. He was like a Mozart for our generation.</p>
        <p>His guitar playing was phenomenal, as you can see in the clip below from the 2004 Rock & Roll Music Hall of Fame Inductions:

        <p class="text-center">Sadly, Prince passed away on April 21, 2016, he was just 57 years old.</p>
        <p class="text-center paradise">May he rest forever in a purple paradise.</p>
